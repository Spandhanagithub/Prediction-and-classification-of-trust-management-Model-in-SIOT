Here's a step-by-step procedure to run your project code using Anaconda Prompt:

1. **Copy the Path of the Project:**
   - Locate the folder where your project is stored.
   - Right-click on the folder and select "Copy as path" (on Windows) or copy the path manually (on other operating systems).

2. **Open Anaconda Prompt:**
   - On Windows, search for "Anaconda Prompt" in the Start menu and open it.
   - On macOS or Linux, open your terminal and type `anaconda-navigator` if Anaconda Navigator is installed, then launch the prompt from there.

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   - In the Anaconda Prompt, type `cd ` followed by the path you copied. For example:
     ```sh
     cd "C:\Users\YourUsername\path\to\your\project"
     ```
     Ensure the path is in quotes if it contains spaces.

4. **Run the Python Application:**
   - Once you are in the project directory, type the following command to run your application:
     ```sh
     python app.py
     ```

5. **Access the Login Page:**
   - Open a web browser and go to the URL specified by your application, commonly `http://localhost:5000` or another port number.

6. **Login:**
   - On the login page, enter the username as `admin`.
   - Enter the password as `admin`.
   - Click on the login button to access the application.

Here is a condensed version of the steps in case you need a quick reference:

1. Copy the project path.
2. Open Anaconda Prompt.
3. Type `cd "path\to\your\project"` and press Enter.
4. Type `python app.py` and press Enter.
5. Open the login page in your browser.
6. Enter `admin` for both username and password.

This procedure should get your application up and running smoothly.
